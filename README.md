# system-logger
Generate system logs with useful information.
## Purpose
Provide a clean, lightweight, and practical way to track system resource consumption over time.
## Install
To install you must run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/estevaopbs/system-logger.git
cd system-logger
chmod +x install
./install
```
Then reopen your shell to reload the bash settings and you're good to go.
## Usage
```bash
logger-start    # starts the system-logger
logger-stop     # stops the system-logger
```
Since it's still a quite simple application it doesn't do some trivial verifications. Multiple instances of system-logger can run at the same time generating unwanted behavior. Please make sure no instance of system-logger is running before run ```logger-start```.
## Dependencies
The only dependency it has is on **```zip```** package. Install it via the package manage of the distro you are using.
## Configuration
System logger has only two execution parameters which can be found at ```~/.config/system-logger.conf```. The default configuration is
```conf
time_interval=60
log_dir=$HOME/.cache/system-logger
```
**time_interval** - Time interval between each two consecutive registers.

**log_dir** - Directory in which the log files will be stored.
## Functioning
The script works by reading the files generated by the kernel and transposing the most relevant data into a csv file.
## Compatibility
The tool is set up to only work with bash shell, because it uses aliases stored in the .bashrc file during installation. However, it can easily be adapted to work with other shells. To do this, you just need to add the equivalent of the following bash code to the end of the equivalent of the .bashrc file for the specific shell you are using.
```bash
PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
alias logger-start="nohup system-logger &> $HOME/.cache/system-logger/logger-execution.log &"
alias logger-stop="kill \$(ps -ef | grep system-logger | grep -v grep | awk '{print \$2}')"
```
## Uninstall
To uninstall the system-logger you must just cd to the system-logger directory (the one which was cloned from git), then run
```
chmod +x uninstall
./uninstall
```
Then remove the aliases added to .bashrc by at installation. If you're running it on other shell than bash, then also remove the aliases you added to the equivalent of the .bashrc file for the shell you are using.
